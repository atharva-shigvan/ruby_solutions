You and three friends go to a baseball game and you offer to go to the concession stand for everyone. They each order one thing, and you do as well. 
Nachos and Pizza both cost $6.00. A Cheeseburger meal costs $10. Water is $4.00 and Coke is $5.00. Tax is 7%.
Task
Determine the total cost of ordering four items from the concession stand. If one of your friendâ€™s orders something that isn't on the menu, you will order a Coke for them instead.
