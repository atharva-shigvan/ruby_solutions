=begin
If you live in Neverland, you never get any older! You and your twin go to Neverland for an afternoon, then your twin goes back home and you stay. 
Over time, how much older is your twin than you, and how old are they?
Task: 
Evaluate the difference between your ages, and the age that your twin is now if you are given the age that you were when you got to Neverland, 
and the time that has elapsed since then.

print "My twin is #{new} years old and they are #{time} years older than me"
